# Hands-on Activity 0

Welcome to the hands-on activities of the IR in Practice session at AFIRM 2019.

In this setting-the-scene activity we are going to familiarise ourself with the workstation at our disposal (a Linux box running Ubuntu 17.10) with both graphical and command line interfaces. We will often use the command line interface, so locate this and open a new command line.

## Preliminary activities

From the command line interface, clone the GitHub repository https://github.com/ielab/afirm2019. You do thi by typing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ielab/afirm2019.git
```
